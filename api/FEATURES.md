This file shall keep track of all the features that we would like to build next:
1. A simple chat interface within VScode to interact with language models
2. Writing simple instructions from the commandline to make modifications in a file. For example, "Find the latest version of openai python library, install it locally to this environment and add it to the requirements.txt file"
3. Question Answering System based on any library documentation or Github repository code or issues.
4. Browse through my current directory and its sub directories and tell me if I have hard coded file path in any of them
5. Install the missing libraries with user's consent
6. Execute natural languange commands fromt the terminal
